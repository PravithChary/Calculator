# Calculator
* A minor project of Front End Development

Hi, I made this project while learning the Front End Dev. 

## About the Project
* A calculator to perform simple algebraic operations of rational numbers. So `.` is also included.

* It includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, finding percentage ( `%` ) (division by 100), usage of negative rational numbers  ( `+/-` ) and an `AC` (All Clear) button.

* Division by `0` results in `infinity`.

* I have used `HTML` , `CSS` and `JavaScript` to build this project.
